\title{Set Log File}
\usage{
setLogFile(logfile = NULL, confirm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{logfile}{Full path to log file. Until other output formats are
introduced, the file name must end in ".json".}

\item{confirm}{Print confirmation of log file setting? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Set the log file that loggit will write to. No logs will be written until
this is set, as per CRAN policy. The suggested use of this function would be
to call it early, to log to the current working directory, as follows:
\code{setLogFile(paste0(getwd(), "/loggit.json"))}. If you are using \code{loggit} in
your package, you can wrap this function in \code{.onLoad()} so that the logfile
is set when your package loads.

\examples{
setLogFile(paste0(tempdir(), "/loggit.json"))
