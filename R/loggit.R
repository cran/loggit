#' Log Message to Output File
#'
#' This function executes immediately before the function definitions for the
#' base handler functions ([message][base::message], [warning][base::warning],
#' and [stop][base::stop], and logs their timestamped output (a bit more
#' verbosely) to a log file. The log file defaults to a
#' [JSON](https://www.json.org/) file, which is a portable file format that is
#' easily parsed by many systems, but will eventually have a `.txt` option as
#' well.
#'
#' While this function has an intended use of logging handler messages without
#' any direct user interaction, it is flexible enough to be used as you see fit.
#'
#' @param log_lvl Level of log output. In actual practice, one of "INFO",
#'   "WARN", and "ERROR" are common, but any string may be supplied.
#' @param log_msg Main log message.
#' @param log_detail Additional detail recorded along with a log message.
#' @param ... A named `list` or named `vector` (each element of length one) of
#'   other custom fields you wish to log. You do not need to explicitly provide
#'   these fields as a formal list or vector, as shown in the example; R handles
#'   the coercion.
#' @param echo Should a message be printed to the console as well? Defaults to
#'   `TRUE`, and is truncated to just the level & message of the log. This
#'   argument is passed as `FALSE` when called from `loggit`'s handlers, since
#'   they still call base R's handlers at the end of execution, all of which
#'   print to the console as well.
#'
#' @examples
#'  loggit("INFO", "This is a message", but_maybe = "you want more fields?",
#'  sure = "why not?", like = 2, or = 10, what = "ever")
